# Microsoft Terminal


## Microsoft Terminal installieren

### Microsoft Store
https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=de-de&gl=de

### Via Builds von GitHub
https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases

For users who are unable to install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store,
released builds can be manually downloaded from this repository's [Releases
page](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases).

Download the `Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<versionNumber>.msixbundle` file from
the **Assets** section. To install the app, you can simply double-click on the
`.msixbundle` file, and the app installer should automatically run. If that
fails for any reason, you can try the following command at a PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
# NOTE: If you are using PowerShell 7+, please run
# Import-Module Appx -UseWindowsPowerShell
# before using Add-AppxPackage.

Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<versionNumber>.msixbundle
```

> **Note**: If you install Terminal manually:
>
> * You may need to install the [VC++ v14 Desktop Framework Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/cpp/c-runtime-packages-desktop-bridge#how-to-install-and-update-desktop-framework-packages).  
>   This should only be necessary on older builds of Windows 10 and only if you get an error about missing framework packages.
> * Terminal will not auto-update when new builds are released so you will need
>   to regularly install the latest Terminal release to receive all the latest
>   fixes and improvements!
