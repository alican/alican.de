My name is Alican Toprak and I'm a passionated software developer based in Frankfurt/Germany.

I'm currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Adesso SE](https://www.adesso.de/de/) and beside that I'm interested in cooking, coffee brewing, woodworking and bicycling. And this is my personal web page and where I try to publish all my findings and thoughts for everyone.
